# STM32 Temperature Sensor with OLED Screen

This project is an example of interfacing an OLED screen with an STM32 microcontroller to display temperature data from a sensor. It serves as a basic demonstration of hardware integration, data acquisition, and OLED display control. Please note that this project is a work in progress and currently contains a data frame structure responsible for communication with the STM32.

## Features

- Read temperature data from a sensor.
- Display temperature readings on an OLED screen.
- Example code for STM32 microcontroller.
- Easily adaptable for other sensor and display combinations.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- STM32 microcontroller (e.g., STM32 NUCLEO-F303RE).
- Temperature sensor (DS18B20).
- OLED display (SSD1306).
- [Development environment for STM32]().
- Necessary libraries for sensor and display.

## Hardware

- Connect the temperature sensor to the appropriate pins on the STM32.
- Connect the OLED display to the STM32 using the required connections.
- Ensure that all connections are properly made, and power up the hardware.
